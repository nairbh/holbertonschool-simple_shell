.SH NAME
       simple-shell - A simple re-creation of Unix shell.

.SH SYNOPSIS
       simple-shell

.SH DESCRIPTION
       The simple-shell command launches a basic Unix shell that allows users to interact with
       their operating system through a command-line interface. It supports executing commands,
       running scripts, and basic shell operations.

.SH OPTIONS
       -c, --command <command>
              Execute the specified command and exit.

       -h, --help
              Display help information and exit.

.SH SCRIPTS
       The simple-shell can also run shell scripts. A shell script is a file containing a series
       of shell commands that are executed in sequence. To run a script, simply pass its file name
       as an argument to the simple-shell command.

       Note that the script should have the appropriate execute permissions for the user running
       the simple-shell command.

       The simple-shell supports various commands that are common in Unix-like operating systems.
       These include, but are not limited to, the following:

       •  cd <directory>: Change the current working directory to the specified directory.

       •  ls [options] [directory]: List files and directories in the specified directory.

       •  pwd: Print the current working directory.

       •  echo <message>: Display the specified message.

       •  cat <file>: Display the contents of the specified file.

       •  touch <file>: Create a new empty file with the specified name.

       •  rm <file>: Remove the specified file.

       •  mv <source> <destination>: Move or rename a file or directory.

       •  cp <source> <destination>: Copy a file or directory.
